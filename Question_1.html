    <h1>Pakistan Zindabad</h1>

    <h2>Independence Day</h2>
    <p><b style="color: green;"> Day (Urdu: یوم-آزادی, Yaum-e-Azadi)</b>, observed annually on 14 August, is a national holiday in Pakistan. It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the <b>British Raj in 1947</b>. On 14 August 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan became independent, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first governor general in Karachi. Independence was marked with widespread celebration, but the atmosphere remained heated given the communal riots prevalent during <i style="color: green;"><b>independence in 1947</b></i>.</p>

    <h2>Sindh</h2>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Sindh (Sindhi: سنڌ; Urdu: سندھ; historically romanized as Sind)</b> is one of the four provinces of Pakistan. Located in the southeastern region of the country, Sindh is the <b>third-largest province</b> of Pakistan by total area and the <b>second-largest</b> province by population after Punjab. It shares land borders with the Pakistani provinces of <b>Balochistan and Punjab</b> to the north, respectively, and the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east; it is also bounded by the Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh's landscape consists mostly of alluvial plains flanking the Indus River, the Thar Desert in the eastern portion of the province along the international border with India, and the Kirthar Mountains in the western portion of the province.</p>

    <h2>Punjab</h2>
    <p><b style="color: green;"> (Punjabi and Urdu: پنجاب, Panjab)</b> <b>is one of the four provinces</b> of Pakistan. Punjab is the second-largest province of Pakistan by land area and the most populous Pakistani province. Forming the bulk of the transnational Punjab region between Pakistan and India, it is bounded locally by Sindh to the south, Balochistan to the west, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the northwest, the Islamabad Capital Territory to the north, and the Pakistani-administered territory of <b>Azad Jammu and Kashmir</b> to the northeast. On its eastern side, it is bounded by the India-Pakistan border, sharing an international boundary with the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east and southeast, respectively, and a disputed boundary with the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast. The province's capital is Lahore—a cultural, historical, economic, and cosmopolitan center of Pakistan.</p>
    <h2>Balochistan</h2>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Balochistan (Balochi: بلوچِستان)</b> is <b>one of the four</b> provinces of Pakistan.

It is located in the northwestern region of the country, along the <b>Afghanistan–Pakistan border</b>, and the city of <b>Peshawar</b> serves as its capital. While it is the <b>third-largest</b> Pakistani province in terms of both its population and its economy, it is geographically the smallest.</p>

    <p><b style="color: green;">Gilgit-Baltistan (Urdu: گلگت بلتستان)</b>, formerly known as the Northern Areas, is a region administered by Pakistan as an autonomous territory, and constituting the northern portion of the <b>larger Kashmir</b> region which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan <b>since 1947</b>, and between India and China from somewhat later.
